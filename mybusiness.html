        <!-- About Owner-->
      Hi! My name is Sitara! I&apos;ve been in love with food since I can remember. Growing up, I loved to experiment with new flavor combinations and new recipes. My friends have always loved the innovative flavors I&apos;ve used in my cookies, and that had inspired me to start this business.</p>
      <!-- About Company-->
      <p class="about-company">Sitara&apos;s Cookies began in 2014 as a way for the owner to earn money to pay her way through college. The shop only featured a few, basic cookie varieties like sugar cookies, snickerdoodles and chocolate chip cookies due to limited resouces and time.</p>

      <p class="about-company">Within a year, the shop established a physical location in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, CA, featuring ten different cookie flavors every day. Since then, the store has expanded to multiple locations across the Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area. The owner now focusses on producing cookies using locally sourced, seasonal ingredients to establish the high quality of cookies produced. The cookie flavors, therefore, may vary based on location.</p>

      <p class="about-company">There are two types of cookies sold at Sitara's cookies: Classic Cookies and Experimental Cookies. Classic cookies include flavors like chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal raisin cookies, and so on. Experimental cookies take a more gourmet and artisnal view on the definition of a cookie, introducing flavors like Pretzel &amp; Peanut Butter, and Chilli Mango cookies.</p>
